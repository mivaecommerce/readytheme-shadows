## Features

#### Refined Checkout

Building upon the streamlined checkout built into Elements, Shadows offers 
a more styled approach to the checkout process..

#### Customer Dashboard

The account landing page has been rethought and restyled to give returning 
customers more, 'at-a-glance', information. Customers will be able to see 
recent orders, wish list items, saved credit cards, and much more.

#### Narrowed Content

Shadows has a narrower content section that Elements which can make a store feel 
a little less cramped on smaller screens.

#### Fasten Header Extension

Adds functionality for a "sticky" header on the site for larger screens.

#### Collapsing Breadcrumbs Extension

Automatically shorten/collapses breadcrumbs on smaller screens so save space.

#### Transfigure Navigation Extension

Allows the standard drop-down menu on larger screens to "transfigure" to an 
off-canvas menu on smaller screens.
