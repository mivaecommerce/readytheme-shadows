> The framework is designed to be used as a foundation for building custom websites, or your own ReadyThemes. While the core of the framework is a tested, CSS base, we also include quality tested JavaScript functionality and extensions like tabs, accordions, carousels, and more.

The latest version of Shadows is shipped with new releases of Miva. If you would like to use the developer edition, you can clone the repository from GitHub:

### What's New in Shadows v2.0.0

We examined the way ReadyThemes worked with the core software and wanted a tighter integration. To that end, Shadows is now the default Framework installed in any _new_ Miva store. While working on this, we made some improvements to the original version of Shadows.

*   Cleaned and trimmed up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
*   Improved accessibility for better user inclusivity.
*   Compliant with the latest Google Web Vitals metrics.
*   Improved overall Page Speed Metrics.

Additionally, you now have the option to use a developer version of Shadows for your site builds.

*   Native support of CSS custom properties (variables).
*   Native support for SCSS.
*   Gulp build process to output a single CSS file and a single JS file.

### Extensible

Includes the necessary building blocks to create many of the common UX design patterns. Unique components can easily be created by extending the framework.

### BEM-IT-ECSS

Developed with the [BEMIT methodology](//csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/) in mind. [BEM](//getbem.com/introduction/) promotes component modularity, [IT](//itcss.io/) helps control the architecture, and [ECSS](//ecss.benfrain.com/) helps to make extending the framework more manageable.

### Modern Layout

Shadows is an evergreen-browser framework with a modern Flexbox layout system. No more having to remember to clear your floats or use conditional classes.

### Accessibility/Inclusivity

With the importance of inclusivity in website layout in mind, Shadows ships with a high level of accessibility as tested through for [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) Level A and Level AA as well as [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) standards for accessibility as tested through [ARC by The Paciello Group](https://www.paciellogroup.com/toolkit/), [Axe by Deque](https://www.deque.com/axe/), and [WAVE by WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/).

## Browser Support

While every effort has been made to make sure Shadows performs across a variety of devices and browsers, there is only so much shimming that can be done without sacrificing performance. Shadows uses current coding structures and standards. This framework may not be best suited for you if you are looking to support legacy browsers. 

- Chrome (_latest 2_)
- Firefox (_latest 2_)
- Safari iOS/MacOS (_latest 2_)
	- Versions of Safari lower than 11 have minimal support, this theme may not work in versions lower than 10. Generally, the site will operate, however there are layout inconsistencies due to the way the browsers supports flex-box and sizing calculations.
- Opera (_latest 2_)
- Edge (_latest 2_)
	- Internet Explorer 11 has minimal support. It will operate, however there are layout inconsistencies due to the way the browser supports flex-box and sizing calculations.
